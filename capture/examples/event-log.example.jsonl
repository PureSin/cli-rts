making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\nEOF\n)\"","description":"Create pull

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

→ gh pr create --title \"feat(render): make map text selectable\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n\n- Region labels and file names in the map overlay now have `pointer-events: auto` and `cursor: text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes:

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the

text`, making them click-selectable/copyable in the browser\n- Camera pan still works from any empty canvas area; zoom (scroll wheel) is preserved by extracting `Camera.onWheel()` and forwarding overlay wheel events to it\n- Applied changes to both the `.ts` sources and their pre-compiled `.js` counterparts (Vite resolves explicit `.js` imports to the literal `.js` files at runtime)\n\n## Changes\n\n- `render/src/renderer/MapOverlay.ts` / `.js` — add `pointer-events:auto;cursor:text` to label and file-list elements\n- `render/src/core/Camera.ts` / `.js` — extract wheel handler into public `onWheel(e)` method\n- `render/src/main.ts` — forward `overlayContainer` wheel events to `camera.onWheel()` so zoom works when hovering over text\n- `render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — Puppeteer smoke test: spins up the fixture server, loads the page, selects a label via the Selection API, and asserts non-empty text is returned\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Automated smoke test passes: `node render/scripts/test-text-selection.js` — 15 selectable elements found, `\"root\"` selected successfully\n- [x] Screenshot confirms blue selection highlight on map label\n- [ ] Manual: open the render page, click-drag over a region name or file name to select and copy it\n- [ ] Manual: verify camera pan still works by dragging from an empty map area\n- [ ] Manual: verify scroll-to-zoom still works when hovering over a text label\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude
